# The Helvetica Scenario

The Helvetica Scenario is a (soon to be) collection of tutorials
that I've handwritten for the course [Business Analytics](https://github.com/pilsung-kang/Business-Analytics-IME654-)
at Korea University.

--------------------------

## 1. Dimensionality Reduction

This is the markdown for the first assignment: [Genetic Algorithm Markdown tutorial](https://github.com/tomtom1103/The_Helvetica_Scenario/blob/main/genetic_algorithm/GA_tutorial.md).

--------------------------

## 2. Kernel Based Learning

This is the markdown for the second assignment: [Support Vector Machine Tutorial](https://github.com/tomtom1103/The_Helvetica_Scenario/blob/main/kernel_based_learning/SVM_tutorial.md).

--------------------------

## 3. Anomaly Detection

This is the markdown for the third assignment: [Anomaly Detection](https://github.com/tomtom1103/The_Helvetica_Scenario/blob/main/anomaly_detection/anomaly_detection_tutorial.md).

--------------------------

## 4. Ensemble Learning

This is the markdown for the fourth assignment: [Ensemble Learning](https://github.com/tomtom1103/The_Helvetica_Scenario/blob/main/ensemble_learning/ensemble_learning_tutorial.md).

--------------------------
The name 'Helvetica Scenario' derives from Ian Goodfellow's reference of the educational spoof 'Look Around You' in his 2014 GAN paper.
It's when you put too much probability mass in the same place, causing a model collapse.
