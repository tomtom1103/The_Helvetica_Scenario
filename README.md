# The Helvetica Scenario

The Helvetica Scenario is a (soon to be) collection of algorithm codebases
that I've handwritten for the course [Business Analytics](https://github.com/pilsung-kang/Business-Analytics-IME654-)
at Korea University.

This is the markdown for the first assignment: [Genetic Algorithm Markdown tutorial](https://github.com/tomtom1103/The_Helvetica_Scenario/blob/main/genetic_algorithm/GA_tutorial.md).

To run the Genetic Algorithm tutorial, clone/download the repository and run the [Genetic Algorithm Jupyter tutorial](https://github.com/tomtom1103/The_Helvetica_Scenario/blob/main/genetic_algorithm/GA_tutorial.ipynb).

The custom Class can be found in [Genetic Algorithm Class](https://github.com/tomtom1103/The_Helvetica_Scenario/blob/main/genetic_algorithm/GeneticAlgorithm.py).

--------------------------
The name 'Helvetica Scenario' derives from Ian Goodfellow's reference of the educational spoof 'Look Around You' in his 2014 GAN paper.
It's when you put too much probability mass in the same place, causing a model collapse.
